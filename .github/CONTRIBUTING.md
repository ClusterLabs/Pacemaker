# Guidelines for Contributing

First, thanks for your care about the Pacemaker project.

## Code Contributions

Please, make sure you've read [Pacemaker Development](
http://clusterlabs.org/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1-pcs/html-single/Pacemaker_Development/index.html)
document, especially if you are new to the project.

For which branch the pull requests should currently target based
on the ongoing phase of the project (development/release, roughly
corresponding to `master`/`1.1` branches), you can refer to the
[developers](http://clusterlabs.org/mailman/listinfo/developers)
mailing list where the updated instructions are being circulated
(but don't worry too much, as GitHub finally allows [switching target branch](
https://github.com/blog/2224-change-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request)
easily).
