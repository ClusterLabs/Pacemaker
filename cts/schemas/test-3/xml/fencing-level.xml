    <!-- The essential elements of this test are:
         * There are fencing levels with the following index values:
           * 1
           * 5
           * 9
           * 10

         In this situation, the fencing level with index="10" should be dropped.
         All others should remain.

         A fencing level's index must be a positive integer between 1 and 9,
         inclusive. Prior to schema version 4.0, the schema already required an
         index value to be a positive integer, so there is no need to test or
         transform values that are not positive integers.
