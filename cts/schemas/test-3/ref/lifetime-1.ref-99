    <!-- The essential elements of this test are:
         * There are four location constraints:
           * ban-rsc1-node1 uses node/score and has a lifetime element with two
             defined rules.
           * ban-rsc2-node1 uses a top-level rule and has a lifetime element
             with two referenced rules.
           * ban-rsc3-node1 uses node/score and has a lifetime element with one
             defined rule.
           * ban-rsc4-node1 uses a top-level rule and has a lifetime element
             with one referenced rule.
         * There are two colocation constraints:
           * rsc2-with-rsc1 has a lifetime element with two defined rules.
           * rsc4-with-rsc3 has a lifetime element with two referenced rules.
         * There are two order constraints:
           * rsc1-then-rsc2 has a lifetime element with two defined rules.
           * rsc3-then-rsc4 has a lifetime element with two referenced rules.
         * A cluster_property_set ("cluster-properties") references two rules
           that are defined in the lifetime elements of colocation and order
           constraints.

         In this situation:
         * All lifetime elements should be removed.
         * For ban-rsc1-node1, the node/score attributes should be removed and a
           compound "and" rule should be created containing the following:
           * A rule version of the node/score attributes
           * A compound "or" rule containing the lifetime rules
         * For ban-rsc1-node2, a compound "and" rule should be created
           containing the following:
           * The existing top-level rule
           * A compound "or" rule containing the lifetime rules
         * For ban-rsc1-node3, a compound "and" rule should be created
           containing the following:
           * A rule version of the node/score attributes
           * The lifetime rule
         * For ban-rsc1-node4, a compound "and" rule should be created
           containing the following:
           * The existing top-level rule
           * The lifetime rule
         * A new location constraint should be created with a rsc-pattern that
           can't match any resources. It should have a compound rule containing
           all the rules defined in the lifetime elements of the colocation and
           order constraints that are referenced elsewhere
           (rsc2-with-rsc1-lifetime-rule1 and rsc1-then-rsc2-lifetime-rule2).
