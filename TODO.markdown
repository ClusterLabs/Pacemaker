# Semi-random collection of tasks we'd like to get done

## Targeted for 1.2
- Move inline function bodies out of headers
  - peer2text, level2char, lrmd_event_type2str, lrmd_event_rc2str, 
- Move location of cib.xml to somewhere more appropriate
- Avoid the use of xmlNode in fencing register_callback() call types
- Need a way to indicate when unfencing operations need to be initiated from the host to be unfenced

## Targeted for 1.2.x

- Allow the N in 'give up after N failed fencing attempts' to be configurable 
- Log cib:diff in compressed form (only the ++ and -- entries)  
- Check for uppercase letters in node names, warn if found
- Imply startup-failure-is-fatal from on-fail="restart" 
- Show an english version of the config with crm_resource --rules
- Convert cts/CIB.py into a supported Python API for the CIB
- Use crm_log_tag() in the PE to allow per-resource trace logging
- Reduce the amount of stonith-ng logging
- Use dlopen for snmp in crm_mon
- Re-implement no-quorum filter for cib updates?

## Targeted for 1.4

- Support A colocated with (B || C || D)
- Implement a truely atomic version of attrd
- Support rolling average values in attrd
- Support heartbeat with the mcp
- Freeze/Thaw
- Create Pacemaker plugin for snmpd - http://www.net-snmp.org/
- Investigate using a DB as the back-end for the CIB
- Decide whether to fully support or drop failover domains
