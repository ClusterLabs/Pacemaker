 *
 * In fact, it's just a wrapper for a graceful conducting of such
 * transformation, in particular, it cares about converting values of some
 * configuration parameters directly in said stylesheet since the desired
 * ANSI colors at the output are not expressible directly (alternative approach
 * to this preprocessing: eventual postprocessing, which is less handy here).
