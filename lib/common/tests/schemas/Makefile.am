# Set up a temporary schemas/ directory containing only some of the full set of
# pacemaker schema files.  This lets us know exactly how many schemas are present,
# allowing us to write tests without having to make changes when new schemas are
# added.
#
# This directory contains the following:
#
# * upgrade-*.xsl        - Required by various schema versions
# * pacemaker-[0-9]*.rng - We're only pulling in 15 schemas, which is enough
#                          to get everything through pacemaker-3.0.rng.  This
#                          includes 2.10, needed so we can check that versions
#                          are compared as numbers instead of strings.
# * other RNG files      - This catches everything except the pacemaker-*rng
#                          files.  These files are included by the top-level
#                          pacemaker-*rng files, so we need them for tests.
#                          This will glob more than we need, but the extra ones
#                          won't get in the way.
