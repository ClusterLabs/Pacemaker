= Configuration Explained =

The walk-through examples use some of these options, but don't explain exactly what they mean or do.  This section is meant to be the go-to resource for all the options available for configuring remote-nodes.

== Resource Options ==

When configuring a virtual machine or lxc resource to act as a remote-node, these are the metadata options available to both enable the resource as a remote-node and define the connection parameters.

.Metadata Options for configurint KVM/LXC resources as remote-nodes
[width="95%",cols="1m,1,4<",options="header",align="center"]
|=========================================================

|Option
|Default
|Description

|+remote-node+
|<none>
|The name of the remote-node this resource defines.  This both enables the resource as a remote-node and defines the unique name used to identify the remote-node. If no other parameters are set, this value will also be assumed as the hostname to connect to at port 3121. +WARNING+ This value cannot overlap with any resource or node IDs.

|+remote-port+
|3121
|Configure a custom port to use for the guest connection to pacemaker_remote.

|+remote-addr+
|+remote-node+ value used as hostname
|The ip address or hostname to connect to if remote-node's name is not the hostname of the guest.

|+remote-connect-timeout+
|60s
|How long before a pending guest connection will time out.

|=========================================================

== Host and Guest Authentication ==

Authentication and encryption of the connection between cluster-nodes (pacemaker) to remote-nodes (pacemaker_remote) is achieved using TLS with PSK encryption/authentication on +tcp port 3121+.  This means both the cluster-node and remote-node must share the same private key.   By default this +key must be placed at "/etc/pacemaker/authkey" on both cluster-nodes and remote-nodes+.

== Pacemaker and pacemaker_remote Options ==

If you need to change the default port or authkey location for either pacemaker or pacemaker_remote, there are environment variables you can set that affect both of those daemons. These environment variables can be enabled by placing them in the /etc/sysconfig/pacemaker file.
