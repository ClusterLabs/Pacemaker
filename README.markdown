# Pacemaker

## What is Pacemaker?

Pacemaker is the resource manager for the
[ClusterLabs](https://www.clusterlabs.org/) open-source high-availability
cluster stack. It coordinates the configuration, start-up, monitoring, and
recovery of interrelated services across all cluster nodes.

## Who is Pacemaker?

Pacemaker was initially created by main architect and lead developer
Andrew Beekhof <andrew@beekhof.net> with the aid of
project catalyst and advocate Lars Marowsky-Br√©e <lmb@suse.de>.

Many, many developers have contributed significantly to the project since.
The git log is the definitive record of their greatly appreciated
contributions.

The wider ClusterLabs community is another essential aspect of the project's
existence, especially the many users who participate in the mailing lists, blog
about HA clustering, and otherwise actively make the project more useful.
